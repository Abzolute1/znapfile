## Frequently Asked Questions

**What is password protection?**
You can set a password on any file transfer. Recipients will need to enter this password before they can download the files.

**Why is account verification required?**
Account verification helps prevent automated abuse and ensures service availability for legitimate users. Free accounts are also limited to 5 transfers per day.

**What is monthly upload limit?**
How much you can upload per month. Use it or lose it - resets on billing date.

**What is active storage?**
How much can be stored at once. If you hit this limit, you can't upload more.

**Simple example:**
Max plan = 1TB uploads per month.
Upload 1TB on day 1? Can't upload more until next month.
Delete 500GB? Still can't upload more. You already used your 1TB for the month.

**Can I upload a file larger than my remaining allowance?**
No. If you have 100GB left this month, you can't upload a 200GB file.

**Why is the maximum file size limited by storage capacity?**
Since files must be stored while they're available for download, the maximum file size cannot exceed your plan's active storage limit.

**How many times can users download my files that are uploaded?**
As many times as they want as long as the file is active.
