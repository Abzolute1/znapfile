# Pricing Implementation Summary

## What's Been Implemented

### 1. Magical Pricing Modal
- Created a beautiful, animated pricing modal component
- Shows all three plans (Free, Pro, Max) with clear pricing
- Highlights features and limitations for each plan
- "Most Popular" badge on Pro plan
- Smooth animations and gradients for visual appeal

### 2. First-Time Login Pricing Prompt
- When users log in for the first time, they see the pricing modal
- They can choose to continue with the free plan or upgrade
- The selection is saved in local storage
- Modal can be closed (defaults to free plan)

### 3. Backend Plan Enforcement
- Created plan limits configuration:
  - **Free**: 2GB monthly, 1GB files, 24hr expiry, 5 transfers/day
  - **Pro**: 300GB monthly, 300GB files, 1-14 day expiry, unlimited transfers
  - **Max**: 1TB monthly, 1TB files, 1-30 day expiry, unlimited transfers, API access
- Enforces all limits on upload:
  - File size limits
  - Monthly transfer limits
  - Active storage limits
  - Daily transfer limits (free plan only)
  - Email verification requirement

### 4. Plan Display in Dashboard
- Shows current plan badge next to user email
- Displays plan usage metrics:
  - Monthly transfer usage
  - Active storage usage (Pro/Max only)
  - Daily transfers (Free only)
- Visual progress bars with color coding
- "Upgrade Plan" button for free users

### 5. API Endpoints
- `/api/v1/plans/` - Get all available plans
- `/api/v1/plans/select` - Select a plan (currently free only)
- `/api/v1/plans/current` - Get current plan and usage

## How It Works

### For New Users:
1. User registers and logs in
2. Pricing modal appears automatically
3. User selects a plan (or closes modal for free plan)
4. Plan selection is saved
5. User is redirected to dashboard

### For Existing Users:
- Login works normally
- Dashboard shows their current plan
- Upload limits are enforced based on plan

### Plan Limits:
- Upload attempts check all limits before processing
- Clear error messages explain which limit was hit
- Users can see their usage in the dashboard

## Frontend Components:
- `PricingModal.jsx` - The magical pricing display
- Updated `LoginPage.jsx` - Shows modal on first login
- Updated `DashboardPage.jsx` - Shows plan info and usage
- Updated `useStore.js` - Tracks pricing seen and selected plan

## Backend Updates:
- `plan_limits.py` - Defines all plan limits
- `plans.py` - API endpoints for plan management
- Updated `upload.py` - Enforces plan limits
- Updated `user.py` - Added Pro and Max tiers

## Notes:
- Pro and Max plans would require Stripe integration for payments
- Currently, users can only select the free plan
- All limits are enforced server-side for security
- Plan information persists across sessions
