# XSS Security Audit Report

## Executive Summary

I've conducted a comprehensive security audit of the React/FastAPI file sharing application focusing on Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities. The application demonstrates **good security practices** with proper input sanitization and output encoding.

## Key Findings

### ✅ No Critical XSS Vulnerabilities Found

1. **No use of `dangerouslySetInnerHTML`** - The application does not use React's `dangerouslySetInnerHTML` prop anywhere in the source code (only found in node_modules).

2. **React's Automatic XSS Protection** - All user-controlled data is displayed using React's JSX expressions (e.g., `{file.original_filename}`, `{file.description}`), which automatically escapes HTML entities.

3. **Backend Input Sanitization** - The backend properly sanitizes filenames using `FilenameValidator.sanitize_filename()` which:
   - Removes path components
   - Removes null bytes
   - Replaces path separators
   - Allows only safe characters `[a-zA-Z0-9._\- ]`
   - Prevents hidden files
   - Limits filename length

### ⚠️ Minor Findings

1. **Hard-coded innerHTML usage** - Found one instance in `CollectionPublicPage.jsx:327`:
   ```javascript
   e.target.parentElement.innerHTML = '<p class="text-text-muted">Failed to load image</p>'
   ```
   This is **safe** as it uses hard-coded HTML, not user input.

2. **User-controlled fields without explicit sanitization**:
   - File descriptions
   - File notes
   - Collection descriptions
   - Collection readme content

   While these are displayed safely in React (auto-escaped), they are stored in the database without HTML sanitization.

## Security Recommendations

### 1. Add Backend HTML Sanitization for Text Fields

Although React protects against XSS when displaying data, it's best practice to sanitize HTML on the backend before storage:

```python
# In app/core/validators.py
from bleach import clean

def sanitize_user_content(content: str) -> str:
    """Sanitize user-provided HTML content"""
    return clean(
        content,
        tags=['b', 'i', 'u', 'em', 'strong', 'a', 'p', 'br'],
        attributes={'a': ['href', 'title']},
        strip=True
    )
```

Apply this to:
- File descriptions and notes
- Collection descriptions and readme content

### 2. Content Security Policy (CSP)

Add CSP headers to prevent XSS attacks:

```python
# In app/main.py
from fastapi.middleware.cors import CORSMiddleware

@app.middleware("http")
async def add_security_headers(request: Request, call_next):
    response = await call_next(request)
    response.headers["Content-Security-Policy"] = (
        "default-src 'self'; "
        "script-src 'self' 'unsafe-inline' 'unsafe-eval'; "
        "style-src 'self' 'unsafe-inline'; "
        "img-src 'self' data: blob:; "
        "font-src 'self' data:; "
        "connect-src 'self' api.yourcdndomain.com;"
    )
    response.headers["X-Content-Type-Options"] = "nosniff"
    response.headers["X-Frame-Options"] = "DENY"
    response.headers["X-XSS-Protection"] = "1; mode=block"
    return response
```

### 3. URL Parameter Validation

While React Router handles URL parameters safely, ensure backend validation for:
- Short codes
- File IDs
- Collection slugs

### 4. File Upload Security

Current implementation is good, but consider:
- Serving uploaded files from a separate domain
- Setting proper Content-Type headers
- Using Content-Disposition: attachment for downloads

### 5. API Response Headers

Ensure all API responses have proper Content-Type headers:
```python
response.headers["Content-Type"] = "application/json"
```

## Areas Checked

✅ Frontend components displaying file names  
✅ Backend endpoints returning user data  
✅ File upload handling and validation  
✅ URL parameter usage  
✅ Direct DOM manipulation  
✅ HTML injection patterns  
✅ File metadata display (descriptions, notes)  
✅ Collection data display  

## Conclusion

The application has **strong XSS protection** thanks to:
- React's automatic HTML escaping
- Proper filename sanitization
- No use of dangerous DOM manipulation methods

The recommendations above would add defense-in-depth but are not critical vulnerabilities. The application is currently **safe from XSS attacks** in its normal operation.

## Testing Recommendations

1. Test with XSS payloads in:
   - File names: `<script>alert('XSS')</script>.txt`
   - Descriptions: `<img src=x onerror=alert('XSS')>`
   - Collection names and readme content

2. Verify Content-Type headers on file downloads

3. Test file preview functionality with malicious HTML files

4. Audit third-party dependencies for known XSS vulnerabilities
