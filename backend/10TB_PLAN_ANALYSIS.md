# 10TB Plan Feasibility Analysis

## Cost Calculation for 10TB Plan

### Storage Costs (Main Factor)
Assuming similar usage patterns to Max tier:
- **Average case**: 30% utilization, 7-day retention
  - 3TB × 7 days ÷ 30 = 0.7TB-months
  - Cost: 700GB × $0.015 = **$10.50/month**

- **Heavy usage**: 50% utilization, 14-day retention
  - 5TB × 14 days ÷ 30 = 2.33TB-months
  - Cost: 2,330GB × $0.015 = **$34.95/month**

- **Worst case**: 100% utilization, 20-day retention
  - 10TB × 20 days ÷ 30 = 6.67TB-months
  - Cost: 6,670GB × $0.015 = **$100.05/month**

### Pricing Strategy Options

#### Option 1: Fixed Margin (50% on worst case)
- Price: **$199/month**
- Worst case profit: $99
- Typical profit: $164 (82% margin)

#### Option 2: Competitive Market Pricing
Looking at competitors:
- Dropbox: 3TB for $20/month
- Google Drive: 2TB for $10/month
- WeTransfer Pro: 1TB for $12/month

Your advantage: Temporary storage (not permanent)
- Price: **$99/month** (10x current Max plan capacity for 4.5x price)
- Worst case: Break even
- Typical profit: $64 (65% margin)

#### Option 3: Tiered Duration Pricing (RECOMMENDED)
Create multiple 10TB options:
- **10TB-7**: 7-day max expiry - **$79/month**
  - Worst case: 10TB × 7 days = $35 cost, $44 profit
- **10TB-14**: 14-day max expiry - **$129/month**
  - Worst case: 10TB × 14 days = $70 cost, $59 profit
- **10TB-30**: 30-day max expiry - **$249/month**
  - Worst case: 10TB × 30 days = $150 cost, $99 profit

## Market Considerations

### Who Needs 10TB?
1. **Video Production Companies**
   - 4K/8K raw footage (500GB-2TB per project)
   - Need to share with remote editors
   - Duration: Usually 7-14 days

2. **Research Institutions**
   - Large datasets, genomic data
   - Collaborative sharing
   - Duration: Often 30+ days

3. **Game Developers**
   - Build distributions (50-100GB per build)
   - Multiple versions
   - Duration: 7-14 days typically

4. **Backup Services**
   - Temporary large backups during migrations
   - Duration: Usually short (3-7 days)

### Risks of 10TB Plan

1. **Attracts Different Customers**
   - More likely to be businesses
   - Higher support expectations
   - May demand SLAs

2. **Abuse Potential**
   - Could become unofficial backup service
   - Piracy concerns at this scale
   - Single user could impact performance

3. **Technical Challenges**
   - Upload time for 10TB (28+ hours at 1Gbps)
   - Need multipart upload optimization
   - May need dedicated infrastructure

## RECOMMENDATION

### YES, create 10TB plans, but:

1. **Use Tiered Duration Model**
   ```
   ULTRA-7:  10TB, 7-day expiry - $79/month
   ULTRA-14: 10TB, 14-day expiry - $129/month
   ULTRA-30: 10TB, 30-day expiry - $249/month
   ```

2. **Add Business Features**
   - Priority support
   - API access included
   - Transfer statistics dashboard
   - Custom branding options
   - Team member access

3. **Implement Safeguards**
   - Require business verification
   - Manual approval for first month
   - Bandwidth throttling if needed
   - Clear "file sharing, not backup" terms

4. **Marketing Position**
   "For teams that share massive files"
   - Video production houses
   - Game development studios
   - Research collaborations
   - Architecture/CAD firms

## Implementation Checklist

- [ ] Add UserTier.ULTRA to models
- [ ] Update plan_limits.py with 10TB limits
- [ ] Implement faster upload system (parallel chunks)
- [ ] Add business verification flow
- [ ] Create enterprise support queue
- [ ] Update billing to handle $79+ charges
- [ ] Add monitoring for 1TB+ files
- [ ] Test infrastructure with 10TB loads

## Financial Projection

Assuming 10 ultra users per month:
- Average revenue: $129 × 10 = $1,290
- Average costs: $35 × 10 = $350
- **Additional profit: $940/month**

Worth pursuing if you can handle enterprise customers!
