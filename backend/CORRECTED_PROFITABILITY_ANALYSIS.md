## Cloudflare R2 Actual Pricing
- **Storage**: $0.015 per GB per month
- **Class A Operations** (writes): $4.50 per million ($0.0000045 per operation)
- **Class B Operations** (reads): $0.36 per million ($0.00000036 per operation)
- **Egress**: **FREE** (No bandwidth charges!)

## PRO PLAN ($6.99/month) - CORRECTED

### Worst Case Scenario:
1. User uploads 300GB on day 1

**Storage Cost:**
- 300GB × 7 days = 2,100 GB-days
- Monthly equivalent: 2,100 ÷ 30 = 70 GB-months
- Cost: 70 × $0.015 = **$1.05**

**Operations Cost:**
- Upload (Class A): ~300 operations × $0.0000045 = **$0.00135**
- Downloads (Class B): 20x multiplier = 6,000 download operations × $0.00000036 = **$0.00216**
- Total Operations: **$0.00351** (less than 1 cent!)

**Total Cost: $1.05 + $0.00351 = $1.05**
**Revenue: $6.99**
**PROFIT: $5.94 (85% margin)**

## MAX PLAN ($21.99/month) - CORRECTED
- **Limits**: 1TB transfer, 1TB storage, 20-day max expiry

### Worst Case Scenario:
1. User uploads 1TB on day 1
2. Keeps it for full 20 days
3. File gets downloaded maximum allowed times (50x with new limits)

**Storage Cost:**
- 1,024GB × 20 days = 20,480 GB-days
- Monthly equivalent: 20,480 ÷ 30 = 683 GB-months
- Cost: 683 × $0.015 = **$10.24**

**Operations Cost:**
- Upload (Class A): ~1,000 operations × $0.0000045 = **$0.0045**
- Downloads (Class B): 50x multiplier = 50,000 operations × $0.00000036 = **$0.018**
- Total Operations: **$0.0225** (about 2 cents!)

**Total Cost: $10.24 + $0.02 = $10.26**
**Revenue: $21.99**
**PROFIT: $11.73 (53% margin)**

## AMAZING DISCOVERY: YOU'RE ALWAYS PROFITABLE!

### With R2's free egress, even worst-case abusers are profitable:

1. **Pro Plan**: Minimum 85% profit margin
2. **Max Plan**: Minimum 53% profit margin

### The Magic of R2:
- Traditional CDNs charge $0.05-0.12 per GB egress
- R2 charges $0 for egress
- This saves you potentially hundreds of dollars per user

### Example:
If a 1TB file is downloaded 50 times:
- **Traditional CDN**: 50TB × $0.05 = $2,500 in bandwidth costs
- **R2**: $0 in bandwidth costs

## REVISED RECOMMENDATIONS

### 1. **Your Original Limits Were Actually Fine!**
The bandwidth multipliers (100x, 1000x) don't matter for costs since egress is free. They only affect:
- Server load
- Potential abuse/piracy concerns
- Quality of service for other users

### 2. **Main Cost Driver is Storage Duration**
- Pro: 300GB for 7 days = $1.05
- Max: 1TB for 20 days = $10.24

### 3. **You Could Even Increase Limits!**
Since bandwidth is free, you could offer:
- "Unlimited downloads" as a selling point
- Higher bandwidth multipliers for premium tiers
- Focus marketing on "No download limits"

### 4. **Real Profit Margins**

#### Typical Pro User (uploads 50GB, 3-day average):
- Cost: $0.08
- Revenue: $6.99
- Profit: $6.91 (99% margin!)

#### Typical Max User (uploads 200GB, 7-day average):
- Cost: $0.98
- Revenue: $21.99
- Profit: $21.01 (95% margin!)

## CONCLUSION

Your business model is actually very profitable! The free egress from R2 makes file sharing extremely cost-effective. Even the most abusive users will only cost you about 50% of their subscription fee, leaving healthy profits.

The main risk isn't profitability - it's:
1. Legal issues (pirated content)
2. Server performance (too many downloads)
3. Storage abuse (keeping files for maximum duration)

But financially, you're in great shape!
