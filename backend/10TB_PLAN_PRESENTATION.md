## 10TB Plan Detailed Calculations

### Worst-Case Scenario (Customer Maximizes Usage)
User uploads 10TB on day 1 and keeps it for the full 30 days:

1. **Convert to GB**: 10TB = 10,240 GB
2. **Calculate storage-months**: 10,240 GB Ã— 30 days Ã· 30 days = 10,240 GB-months
3. **Calculate cost**: 10,240 Ã— $0.015 = **$153.60**
4. **Revenue**: $249.00
5. **Profit**: $249.00 - $153.60 = **$95.40**
6. **Margin**: $95.40 Ã· $249.00 = **38.3%**

### Typical Usage Scenario (More Realistic)
Most users upload files throughout the month and delete after sharing:

**Assumption**: 4TB average usage, 10-day average retention
1. **Storage-months**: 4,096 GB Ã— 10 days Ã· 30 days = 1,365 GB-months
2. **Cost**: 1,365 Ã— $0.015 = **$20.48**
3. **Profit**: $249.00 - $20.48 = **$228.52**
4. **Margin**: $228.52 Ã· $249.00 = **91.8%**

### Light Usage Scenario
User needs 10TB limit but typically uses 2TB:

**Assumption**: 2TB average usage, 7-day average retention
1. **Storage-months**: 2,048 GB Ã— 7 days Ã· 30 days = 478 GB-months
2. **Cost**: 478 Ã— $0.015 = **$7.17**
3. **Profit**: $249.00 - $7.17 = **$241.83**
4. **Margin**: $241.83 Ã· $249.00 = **97.1%**

## Why Downloads Don't Affect Profitability

**Traditional CDN** (like AWS S3):
- 10TB file downloaded 10 times = 100TB bandwidth
- Cost: 100TB Ã— $0.09/GB = **$9,000** ðŸ˜±

**Cloudflare R2**:
- 10TB file downloaded 10 times = 100TB bandwidth
- Cost: **$0** ðŸŽ‰

This is why your business model works!
