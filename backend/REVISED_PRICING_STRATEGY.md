# Revised Pricing Strategy - Smooth Progression

## Current Problem
- Free: $0
- Pro: $6.99 (big jump from free)
- Max: $21.99 (3.1x jump)
- Ultra: $249 (11.3x jump!) üö®

This creates "sticker shock" and missing middle options.

## Option 1: Add Missing Tiers (Recommended)
```
Free:     $0     - 2GB,   1 day
Starter:  $4.99  - 50GB,  3 days  ‚Üê NEW
Pro:      $9.99  - 300GB, 7 days  ‚Üê ADJUSTED
Plus:     $24.99 - 1TB,   14 days ‚Üê RENAMED
Ultra:    $49.99 - 3TB,   20 days ‚Üê NEW
Max:      $99.99 - 10TB,  30 days ‚Üê ADJUSTED
```

**Why This Works:**
- Natural progression: 0‚Üí5‚Üí10‚Üí25‚Üí50‚Üí100
- Each tier ~2-2.5x the previous
- No shocking jumps
- Covers all use cases

## Option 2: Simplified 3-Tier + Enterprise
```
Personal: $9.99  - 300GB, 7 days
Business: $39.99 - 2TB,   14 days  
Team:     $99.99 - 5TB,   20 days
Enterprise: Custom pricing for 10TB+
```

## Option 3: Usage-Based Tiers
```
Lite:    $7.99   - 100GB/month quota
Pro:     $19.99  - 500GB/month quota  
Max:     $49.99  - 2TB/month quota
Ultra:   $149.99 - 10TB/month quota
```

## Option 4: Keep Current + Bridge (Minimal Change)
```
Free:    $0      - 2GB,   1 day
Pro:     $6.99   - 300GB, 7 days   (keep)
Max:     $21.99  - 1TB,   20 days  (keep)
Plus:    $49.99  - 3TB,   20 days  ‚Üê NEW BRIDGE
Ultra:   $99.99  - 10TB,  30 days  ‚Üê ADJUSTED
```

## My Recommendation: Option 4

**Why?**
1. Minimal disruption to existing customers
2. Adds logical stepping stone ($49.99)
3. Makes $99.99 feel reasonable after $49.99
4. Still very profitable:
   - Plus ($49.99): ~$15 cost = 70% margin
   - Ultra ($99.99): ~$50 cost = 50% margin

## Psychological Pricing Analysis

### Current Issues:
- $6.99 ‚Üí $21.99 = "Am I missing something?"
- $21.99 ‚Üí $249 = "That escalated quickly!"

### With Bridge Tier:
- $6.99 ‚Üí $21.99 = 3x (reasonable for 3x storage)
- $21.99 ‚Üí $49.99 = 2.3x (smooth progression)
- $49.99 ‚Üí $99.99 = 2x (natural double)

## Market Positioning

```
Pro ($6.99):     "For freelancers"
Max ($21.99):    "For professionals"  
Plus ($49.99):   "For small teams"
Ultra ($99.99):  "For enterprises"
```

## Financial Impact

Assuming current users stay, adding bridge tiers:
- 20% of Max users upgrade to Plus: +$28 per user
- 10 new Plus users: +$500/month
- 5 new Ultra users: +$500/month
- **Total additional revenue: ~$1,500/month**

## Implementation Priority

1. **Immediate**: Add $49.99 tier (3TB, 20 days)
2. **Next month**: Reduce Ultra to $99.99
3. **Optional**: Add $149.99 tier (10TB, 60 days) for true power users

This creates a smooth pricing ladder that feels natural and captures more revenue from the middle market!
