# Detailed Profitability Analysis: Can Users Cost More Than They Pay?

## R2 Pricing (Cloudflare)
- **Storage**: $0.015 per GB per month
- **Operations**: $0.36 per million requests ($0.00036 per request)
- **Egress**: FREE (this is R2's main advantage)

## PRO PLAN ($6.99/month)
- **Limits**: 300GB transfer, 300GB storage, 7-day max expiry

### Worst Case Scenario:
1. User uploads 300GB on day 1
2. Keeps it for full 7 days
3. File gets downloaded extensively

**Storage Cost Calculation:**
- 300GB × 7 days = 2,100 GB-days
- Monthly equivalent: 2,100 ÷ 30 = 70 GB-months
- Cost: 70 × $0.015 = **$1.05**

**Operations Cost:**
- Upload: ~300 operations (multipart)
- Downloads: Let's say 100x multiplier = 30,000 GB downloaded
- At 1GB chunks = ~30,000 operations
- Total: ~30,300 operations
- Cost: 30,300 × $0.00036 = **$10.91**

**Total Cost: $1.05 + $10.91 = $11.96**
**Revenue: $6.99**
**LOSS: -$4.97 (-71%)**

### More Realistic Pro Scenario:
- Uploads 100GB/month across multiple files
- Average 3-day retention
- 10x download multiplier

**Costs:**
- Storage: 100GB × 3 days ÷ 30 = 10 GB-months × $0.015 = **$0.15**
- Operations: ~1,000 operations × $0.00036 = **$0.36**
- **Total Cost: $0.51**
- **Profit: $6.48 (93% margin)**

## MAX PLAN ($21.99/month)
- **Limits**: 1TB transfer, 1TB storage, 20-day max expiry

### Worst Case Scenario:
1. User uploads 1TB on day 1
2. Keeps it for full 20 days
3. File gets downloaded extensively

**Storage Cost Calculation:**
- 1,024GB × 20 days = 20,480 GB-days
- Monthly equivalent: 20,480 ÷ 30 = 683 GB-months
- Cost: 683 × $0.015 = **$10.24**

**Operations Cost:**
- Upload: ~1,000 operations (multipart)
- Downloads: 1000x multiplier = 1,024,000 GB downloaded
- At 1GB chunks = ~1,024,000 operations
- Total: ~1,025,000 operations
- Cost: 1,025,000 × $0.00036 = **$369.00**

**Total Cost: $10.24 + $369.00 = $379.24**
**Revenue: $21.99**
**LOSS: -$357.25 (-1,625%)**

### More Realistic Max Scenario:
- Uploads 300GB/month
- Average 7-day retention
- 50x download multiplier

**Costs:**
- Storage: 300GB × 7 days ÷ 30 = 70 GB-months × $0.015 = **$1.05**
- Operations: ~15,000 operations × $0.00036 = **$5.40**
- **Total Cost: $6.45**
- **Profit: $15.54 (71% margin)**

## CRITICAL FINDINGS

### YES, BOTH PRO AND MAX USERS CAN CAUSE LOSSES!

1. **Pro Users**: Can cause up to **$5 loss per month** if they abuse bandwidth
2. **Max Users**: Can cause up to **$357 loss per month** with extreme abuse

### The Main Culprit: OPERATIONS COST
- The bandwidth multipliers (100x for Pro, 1000x for Max) create massive operation costs
- A single 1TB file downloaded 1000 times = 1 million operations = $360 in costs!

## URGENT RECOMMENDATIONS

### 1. **IMMEDIATELY REDUCE BANDWIDTH MULTIPLIERS**
```python
"bandwidth_multiplier": {
    UserTier.FREE: 5,      # Was 10
    UserTier.PRO: 20,      # Was 100  
    UserTier.MAX: 50,      # Was 1000 (CRITICAL!)
}
```

### 2. **IMPLEMENT DAILY DOWNLOAD CAPS**
```python
"daily_download_gb": {
    UserTier.FREE: 10,     # 10GB/day max
    UserTier.PRO: 100,     # 100GB/day max
    UserTier.MAX: 500,     # 500GB/day max
}
```

### 3. **ADD OPERATION LIMITS**
```python
"max_operations_per_file": {
    UserTier.FREE: 100,
    UserTier.PRO: 1000,
    UserTier.MAX: 5000,
}
```

### 4. **ADJUST PRICING OR LIMITS**

#### Option A: Reduce Storage Duration
- Pro: 5 days max (was 7)
- Max: 10 days max (was 20)

#### Option B: Increase Prices
- Pro: $9.99/month (was $6.99)
- Max: $39.99/month (was $21.99)

#### Option C: Add Transfer Fees
- After bandwidth limit, charge $0.05/GB

## IMMEDIATE ACTION REQUIRED

The current bandwidth multipliers can bankrupt your service! A single viral file could cost hundreds of dollars while only generating $21.99 in revenue.

**Priority 1**: Update `abuse_prevention.py` bandwidth multipliers
**Priority 2**: Implement daily download caps
**Priority 3**: Add monitoring alerts for files exceeding 10GB daily downloads
