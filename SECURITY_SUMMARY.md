# ZnapFile Security Implementation Summary

## Overview
This document summarizes all security improvements implemented in the ZnapFile application following a comprehensive security audit.

## Key Security Implementations

### 1. Zero-Knowledge Architecture
- **Client-side encryption**: All files encrypted with AES-256-GCM before upload
- **PBKDF2 key derivation**: 600,000 iterations for password-based keys
- **Server never sees**: Unencrypted data, passwords, or encryption keys

### 2. Authentication & Authorization
- **JWT tokens**: With blacklist support for revocation
- **Proof-of-Work**: Required for authentication to prevent brute force
- **CSRF protection**: Custom implementation with time-based tokens
- **Rate limiting**: Exponential backoff on failed attempts

### 3. Critical Vulnerabilities Fixed

#### Password Security
- **Fixed**: Passwords in URL parameters
- **Solution**: Secure token-based system with passwords in request body

#### XSS Protection
- **Fixed**: innerHTML usage allowing script injection
- **Solution**: Safe DOM manipulation with textContent and createElement

#### Encryption Improvements
- **Fixed**: IV reuse for file and metadata
- **Solution**: Separate IVs for each encryption operation

#### Production Security
- **Fixed**: Test endpoints exposed in production
- **Solution**: Removed all debug/test endpoints

#### Token Management
- **Fixed**: No token revocation mechanism
- **Solution**: Redis-based blacklist with JTI tracking

#### DoS Protection
- **Fixed**: Large file uploads causing memory exhaustion
- **Solution**: Streaming file handler with chunk processing

#### Key Management
- **Fixed**: Keys stored directly in config
- **Solution**: Secure key derivation system with rotation support

#### CORS Security
- **Fixed**: Wildcard CORS headers
- **Solution**: Dynamic origin validation against allowed list

#### CSP Headers
- **Fixed**: unsafe-inline allowing inline scripts
- **Solution**: Nonce-based CSP implementation

#### Rate Limiting
- **Fixed**: No rate limiting on PoW challenge generation
- **Solution**: Rate-limited endpoints with adaptive difficulty

## Defense-in-Depth Architecture

### Layer 1: Network Security
- HTTPS only (enforced with HSTS)
- Secure headers (X-Frame-Options, X-Content-Type-Options)
- CORS validation for cross-origin requests

### Layer 2: Application Security
- Input validation and sanitization
- SQL injection prevention with parameterized queries
- Rate limiting on all endpoints
- CSRF protection on state-changing operations

### Layer 3: Authentication Security
- Multi-factor protection (password + PoW)
- Adaptive difficulty based on IP behavior
- Token blacklisting for compromised sessions
- Automatic session invalidation on password change

### Layer 4: Cryptographic Security
- AES-256-GCM for file encryption
- PBKDF2 for key derivation
- Separate IVs for all encryption operations
- Secure random number generation

### Layer 5: Operational Security
- Comprehensive audit logging
- No sensitive data in logs
- Key rotation capabilities
- Incident response procedures

## Security Features by Component

### Frontend
- Client-side encryption before upload
- Secure key derivation from passwords
- XSS prevention with safe DOM manipulation
- No sensitive data in URLs or localStorage

### Backend
- JWT with blacklist support
- Streaming file uploads
- Rate limiting infrastructure
- Proof-of-work verification
- Key management system
- CORS and CSP protection

### Infrastructure
- Redis for token blacklist
- Secure temporary file handling
- Virus scanning integration
- Storage service encryption

## Monitoring & Compliance

### Security Monitoring
- Failed login tracking
- Rate limit violations logged
- Token revocation events tracked
- Key usage audited

### Compliance Features
- Zero-knowledge architecture
- No plaintext data storage
- Secure deletion capabilities
- Audit trail for all operations

## Best Practices Followed

1. **No custom crypto**: Using well-tested libraries only
2. **Defense in depth**: Multiple security layers
3. **Fail secure**: Defaults to most restrictive settings
4. **Least privilege**: Minimal permissions required
5. **Security by design**: Built-in from the start

## Future Considerations

### Post-Quantum Readiness
- Interfaces prepared for quantum-resistant algorithms
- Easy migration path when standards finalize

### Additional Hardening
- Consider hardware security module (HSM) integration
- Implement security information and event management (SIEM)
- Add web application firewall (WAF) rules

## Conclusion

The ZnapFile application now implements comprehensive security measures addressing all critical vulnerabilities found during the audit. The multi-layered security architecture provides strong protection against common attack vectors while maintaining usability.

All security implementations follow industry best practices and use well-tested cryptographic libraries. The system is designed to fail securely and provides comprehensive audit trails for security events.
